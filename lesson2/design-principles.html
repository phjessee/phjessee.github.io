            <p>Invision App has a great example of white space. The moment you land on their page
                It's
                clean with very few a
                simple header that conveys their companies mission and 2 call-to-action buttons. This could be an even
                better example if there was no image in the background but that doesn't create clutter like components
                would</p>

            <p>Microsoft uses the principle of proximity great. The buttons at the top are close together, the text
                below that with the header "Come together" and the paragraph
                indicate proximity or relation. This patter continues on with the
                image and the chat. the image shows a person chatting with the text below that which indicates
                relation/proximity</p>

            <p>Maze Design is a designing platform and so I would expect them to follow design principles to a T. The
                alignment on the home screen is great. The navigation is aligned horizontally and the header, paragraph,
                button and images are all left aligned down the page. Doing that makes it look professionally done.</p>
